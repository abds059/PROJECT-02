            Fighter jets are aircraft designed for combat, with high performance and the ability to operate at
            supersonic speeds for short periods of time. They are characterized by advanced materials and structural
            concepts, as well as high turbine temperatures.
            In military conflict, the role of fighter aircraft is to establish air superiority of the
            battlespace. Domination of the airspace above a battlefield permits bombers and attack aircraft to engage in
            tactical and strategic bombing of enemy targets, and helps prevent the enemy from doing the same.

            The key performance features of a fighter include not only its firepower but also its high speed and
            maneuverability relative to the target aircraft.

            Many modern fighter aircraft also have secondary capabilities such as ground attack and some types, such as
            fighter-bombers, are designed from the outset for dual roles.
